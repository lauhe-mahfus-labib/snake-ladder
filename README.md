# Snake-ladder

The goal of our project is to make a simple and fun game with the knowledge of what we learn from our CSE106-Discrete Mathematics course. In this game, we try to impediment some ideas we learned from our Graph theory and Number theory classes. In this game, our board is a multi directed graph where every square represents a vertex of the graph. There is a connection between two vertices or squares is a path between them. Snake and Ladder are also a path between two vertices or squares. In this game, our dice roll follows number theory. For getting random numbers between 1 to 6.  We followed almost every rule of the original game with some exceptions. Also, we added some extra features to make the game more appealing and fun. Such as showing rolling dice, displaying the snake if any player gets bitten by it, and a ladder if any player gets to climb it. Also, the player is colored and shown moving on the board along with the changing scores on the scoreboard on the right side.
